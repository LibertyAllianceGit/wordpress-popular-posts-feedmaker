Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that creates an RSS feed for WordPress Popular Posts. Once installed and activated, you can find the RSS feed at yoururl.com/feed/popular.

Getting Started

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the WordPress Popular Posts Feedmaker options screen under Settings to configure the plugin.
